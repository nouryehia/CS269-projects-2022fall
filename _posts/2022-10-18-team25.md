# Project Proposal

> The problem we are addressing is the canonical example of HMARL: having two (or more) agents tasked with reaching a target in a gridworld-like environment. One agent is fast and able to observe the environment in an egocentric way and the other is slow and only observes what is directly in front of it. The faster agent cannot move obstacles, while the slower one can. The intent is to teach them to work together in order to clear the obstacles and reach some target in a specified amount of steps.
